* For a list of knwon issues please check the
  [issues list](https://github.com/adrienverge/openfortivpn/issues) on GitHub.
* We try to avoid backwards incompatible changes, but sometimes it is not
  avoidable. When we are aware of compatibility issues, then we recommend to
  check the documentation in the above changelog. When changes turn out to break
  things for some specific configurations after we have tagged a new release,
  the issues list is the right place to report it, so that we can add a hint in
  the changelog for the subsequent release.
